# Callysto

# Requirements
Until we stabilize things we will use:
* LLVM 13
* CLang as CC
* gold as linker

By changing the default `.cargo/config` you can pass use `ld` or `lld` without any problem.

# Rust MSRV
We are using:
```
nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)
rustc 1.61.0-nightly (1eb72580d 2022-03-08)
```
